Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `PyRate` for local development.

1. Fork_ the `PyRate` repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

::

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:<account_where_you_forked>/PyRate.git

3. Create a branch for local development

::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you have finished making changes, check that your changes pass style and unit
   tests. A suite of tests have been developed for use in testing `PyRate` functionality
   and for further code development. The tests use `pytest <http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/>`__
   and can be found in the ``PyRate/tests/`` directory. A small test dataset used by the test suite is included in the repository in the ``PyRate/tests/test_data/small_test`` directory.

::

    cd ~/PyRate
    pytest tests/
    pip install tox
    tox

5. If the tests pass, commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

::

    git add .
    git commit -m "Short description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

   Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6+.

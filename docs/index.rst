Welcome to the documentation for PyRate!
========================================

PyRate is a Python tool for estimating the average rate (velocity) and
incremental time-series of surface movement for every pixel in a stack of
images generated by interferometric processing of Synthetic Aperture Radar
(InSAR) data. It has been designed to use GAMMA or ROI_PAC format geocoded
unwrapped interferograms.

PyRate is a partial Python translation of Pirate_, a Matlab tool developed
by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong University of Technology.

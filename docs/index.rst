PyRate documentation
====================

This is the documentation for the `PyRate` software.

`PyRate` is a Python tool for estimating the average displacement-rate (velocity)
and cumulative displacement time-series of surface movements for every pixel in
a stack of geocoded unwrapped interferograms generated by Interferometric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. `PyRate` uses a "Small
Baseline Subset" (SBAS) processing strategy and currently supports input
data in the `GAMMA` or `ROI\_PAC` software formats.

.. note::

    - Support and development of `ROI\_PAC` has been discontinued.
    - `ROI\_PAC` support in `PyRate` will be deprecated in a future release.

The `PyRate` project started in 2012 as a partial Python translation of
"Pirate", a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong
University of Technology.

# Usage

## Configuration File

Example configuration files for running PyRate with GAMMA or ROI\_PAC format
interferograms are contained in the *configs/* directory.


## PyRate workflow

After following the steps in [Installation](installation.html), an executable program
`pyrate` is created.

Use `help` for the different command line options:

    >> pyrate --help
    Usage: pyrate [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Options:
      -v, --verbosity [DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR]
                                      Level of logging
      --help                          Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      linrate
      postprocess
      prepifg

The `pyrate` program has three command line options corresponding to 
different parts of the PyRate workflow:

1. prepifg
1. linrate
1. postprocess

Below we discuss these options.

### prepifg: Preparing input interferograms

The first step of PyRate is to convert the GAMMA or ROI\_PAC format
unwrapped interferograms into geotiff format, followed by applying
multi-looking and cropping operations. These procedures are all
performed by the `pyrate prepifg` command:

    >> pyrate prepifg --help
    Usage: pyrate prepifg [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

The `prepifg` command is used as follows:

    pyrate prepifg /path/to/config_file

The two major steps during the `prepifg` operation are described below.

#### Data formatting: convert to geotiff

The `prepifg` command will determine the input format from the value
specified at the *processor:* keyword in the config file (0: ROI\_PAC;
1: GAMMA)

Each GAMMA geocoded unwrapped interferogram requires three header files to
extract metadata required for data formatting: a geocoded DEM header file
(*\*.dem.par*), and the master and slave epoch SLC parameter files
(*\*.slc.par*). 

The path and name of the DEM header file are specified in the config file
under the *demHeaderFile:* keyword. 

The SLC parameter files should be in the directory specified in the config
file under the *slcFileDir:* keyword. SLC parameter files for a particular
interferogram are found automatically by date-string pattern matching.

Each ROI_PAC geocoded unwrapped interferogram requires its own header/resource
file (*\*.unw.rsc*). These header files need to be stored in the same directory
as the interferograms.

In addition, the geocoded DEM header file (*\*.dem.rsc*) is required and its
path and name are specified in the config file under the *demHeaderFile:*
keyword. The geographic projection in the parameter *DATUM:* is extracted
from the DEM header file.

#### Image transformations: multilooking and cropping

The `prepifg` command will also perform multi-looking (image
sub-sampling) and cropping of the input interferograms.

Two example configuration files are provided in the *configs/* directory, one
each for ROI_PAC and GAMMA prepifg configuration. Either configuration file
can be used with `prepifg`.


### linrate: Main workflow and linear rate and time series analysis

    >> pyrate linrate --help
    Usage: pyrate linrate [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      -r, --rows INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many rows
      -c, --cols INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many columns
      --help              Show this message and exit


This is the core of the PyRate processing workflow, handled by the `linrate`
command:

    pyrate linrate path/to/config_file -c 3 -r 4

This command will perform the time series and linear rate analysis and has
the option to break the interferograms into a number of tiles in `r` rows and
`c` columns. For example, the above command will break the interferograms
into 12 tiles and will produce 12 linear rate and time series products 
corresponding to each tile.

The optional rows and columns arguments can be used to create smaller tiles
of the full size interferograms. This enables large interferograms to be more
easily be accommodated in memory. The number of tiles chosen should be as small
as possible that fits in the system memory.

Optionally, an orbital error correction and a spatio-temporal filter operation
to estimate and remove atmospheric phase screen signals is applied to the
interferograms prior to time series and linear rate analysis.
The corrected interferograms are updated on disk and the corrections are not
re-applied upon subsequent runs. This functionality is controlled by the
*orbfit:* and *apsest:* options in the configuration file.

Non-optional pre-processing steps include:
- Minimum Spanning Tree matrix calculation
- Identification of a suitable reference pixel
- Removal of reference phase from interferograms
- Calculation of interferogram covariance
- Assembly of the variance-covariance matrix


### postprocess: Putting the tiles back together

The last step of the PyRate workflow is to re-assemble the tiles and save 
geotiff files of the final time series and linear rate products.

    >> pyrate postprocess --help
    Usage: pyrate postprocess [OPTIONS] CONFIG_FILE

    Options:
      -r, --rows INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many rows
      -c, --cols INTEGER  divide ifgs into this many columns
      --help              Show this message and exit.

Make sure to use the same number of rows and columns that was used in the 
previous `linrate` step:

    pyrate postprocess path/to/config_file -c 3 -r 4


## MPI Support

PyRate has been designed for use on High Performance Computers and
instructions to use a HPC cluster can be found in the [hpc guide](hpc).

## Python multiprocessing support

In addition to the MPI support for HPC, PyRate can use standard
multi-threading simply by turning `parallel:  1` in the configuration file
to take advantage of multiple cores on a single PC.

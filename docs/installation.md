# Installation

Before you start, you will need to have a number of packages installed on your
Linux system. These can either be installed directly onto the system, or you
can use a virtual environment.


## Direct Install

Make sure your system has the following packages installed. If not, run the
command:

    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev libpng12-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran libproj-dev openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev netcdf-bin libnetcdf11 libnetcdf-dev


## Virtual Environment

You can use one of the two virtual environment options below:

Note: if you are using a HPC environment, refer to [these instructions instead](hpc.html).


### Virtualenv

1. Install [`virtualenv`](https://gist.github.com/basaks/b33ea9106c7d1d72ac3a79fdcea430eb).

2. You may need to install a slightly older `python-daemon` to install PyRate:


    pip install python-daemon==2.1.1

3. Install PyRate by using one of the following options.

-- Run ``setup.py``:


    python setup.py install

-- Install the latest version of PyRate with ``pip`` from github:


    pip install git+https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PyRate

-- PyRate is also on ``pypi``, the Python package manager. To install, run:


    pip install Py-Rate

The Python requirements should automatically be built and installed.

If `matplotlib` does not install easily in a `virtualenv`, use this:

    sudo apt-get -y build-dep matplotlib

Then re-install `matplotlib` in your `virtualenv`.


### Anaconda

For using PyRate in an Anaconda environment [use this
guide](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PyRate/blob/master/conda.md).


## Tests

A suite of tests have been developed for use in testing PyRate functionality
and for further code development. The tests use
[pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) and can be found in the *tests/*
directory. A small test dataset is included in the *tests/test_data/*
directory.

To run the tests, use the following command inside the top level *PyRate/*
directory:

    pip install pytest
    cd PyRate
    export PYRATEPATH=/path/to/PyRate
    pytest tests/

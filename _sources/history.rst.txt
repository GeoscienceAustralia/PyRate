Release History
===============
0.4.1 (2020-05-19)
-----------------------
Added
+++++
- Python 3.8 support.
- Algorithm to automatically calculate rows and columns for tiling.
  User no longer specifies these as part of the CLI, but can optionally
  specify ``rows`` and ``cols`` in the configuration file.
- Improvements to the test suite, including systems-wide tests.
- Improved logging.

Changed
+++++++
- ``Linear Rate`` algorithm has been renamed ``Stack Rate``.
- User supplies full paths to input files in respective file lists.
- All files generated by `PyRate` saved to user-defined ``outdir`` directory.
- Fixed a bug in how NaNs are handled during coherence masking and multi-looking.
  Output rasters will contain ``nan`` as the nodata value.
- Fixed bug in resampling/multi-looking when coherence masking is used.
  This bugfix will result in significantly fewer ``nan`` pixels in the outputs.
- Renamed ``slcfilelist`` parameter to ``hdrfilelist``.
- Log files are generated in the ``outdir`` and every `PyRate` step produces independent log files.

Removed
+++++++
- Deprecate the use of ``obsdir``, ``slcfiledir`` and ``cohdir`` configuration variables.
- Deprecate ``parallel = 2`` option; splitting image via rows for parallelisation.

0.4.0 (2019-10-31)
-----------------------
Added
+++++
- Python 3.7 support.
- Optional ``conv2tif`` step.
- Building of docs integrated with Travis CI.
- Coherence masking, view coherence masking section in ``input_parameters.conf``
  for options.
- Input parameter validation.
- SLC and coherence file lists for file discovery.
- Create quick view png for rate map product.
- Add support for reading interferogram in Geotiff format.
- Add detailed validation and hints for configuration parameters
- Add system tests for all 3 types of input formats

Changed
+++++++
- ``linrate`` step has been renamed to ``process``.
- ``postprocess`` step has been renamed to ``merge``.
- ``converttogeotiff`` step has been renamed to ``conv2tif``.
- CLI structure: config files now need to be provided with ``-f`` flag.
- Reduced console output, default verbosity setting is now ``INFO``.
- Restructure of code layout, src modules now in ``PyRate/pyrate/core`` directory
  and scripts at ``PyRate/scripts``.
- Reference pixel values are expected to be in latitude and longitude values.

Removed
+++++++
- Unused luigi code.
- References to Matlab.
- Unused tests for legacy api.

0.3.0 (2019-07-26)
-----------------------
Added
+++++
- ``utils/apt_install.sh`` script that lists Ubuntu/apt package requirements.
- ``utils/load_modules.sh`` script that sets up NCI Raijin HPC environment.

Fixed
+++++
- Errors being caused by newer version of ``networkx``; v2.3 now supported.

Removed
+++++++
- Unused Python and OS packages.
- environment.yml - conda env will now be installed using ``requirements.txt``.
- HPC directory - hpc README.rst moved to docs.
- setup.cfg - no longer needed.
- Luigi functionality - hasn't been operational and is reported as vulnerable.
  Single machine parallelism is achieved with joblib. 

Changed
+++++++
- Requirements now managed by ``requirements.txt`` file, parsed by ``setup.py``.
- Requirements now split across base ``requirements.txt`` and separate files
  for dev (``requirements-dev.txt``) and testing ('requirements-test.txt').
- Moved default config files to top level source directory.
- Pinned Python dependencies to specific versions.
- Travis build now installs GDAL from apt.
- Travis only builds on master, develop and \*-travis branches.
- Consolidated documentation into ``PyRate/docs``.
- Updated install instructions for Ubuntu and NCI.

0.2.0 (2017-05-22)
------------------

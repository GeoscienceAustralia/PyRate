PyRate documentation
====================

This is the documentation for the `PyRate` software.

`PyRate` is a Python tool for estimating the velocity and cumulative
displacement time-series of surface movements for every pixel in a stack of
geocoded unwrapped interferograms generated by Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. `PyRate` exploits distributed scatterers
using a "Small Baseline Subset" (SBAS) processing strategy and currently
supports input data in the `GAMMA` or `ROI\_PAC` software formats.
Additionally, the European Space Agency SNAP_ software version 8 has a
"PyRate export" capability that prepares `SNAP` output data in the `GAMMA`
format for use with `PyRate`.

.. note::

    - Support and development of `ROI\_PAC` has been discontinued.
    - `ROI\_PAC` support in `PyRate` will be deprecated in a future release.

The `PyRate` project started in 2012 as a partial Python translation of
"Pirate", a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong
University of Technology.

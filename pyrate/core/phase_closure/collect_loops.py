    Deduplication of loops with same members.

    For example: for nodes 1, 2, 3 in the graph below

        [

            [1, 0, 1],
            [1, 1, 0],
        ]

    Loops of length 3 are 0->1->2 and 0->2->1. We only retain 1 of these loops after dedupe.

    Example 2:
    For the following graph:
            [
                [0, 1, 1, 1],
                [1, 0, 1, 1],

    | *      * |
    |    *     |
    |  *    *  |
    4----------3
